# UPM: User-Guided Page Merging

**A built-in Linux kernel module for memory deduplication in serverless environments**

This repository is a modification of Linux kernel 4.15.0-142-generic. You can find more details in the research paper published at IEEE Big Data 2023.

When using UPM, please cite our BigData 2023 paper. A preprint of the paper is [available on our website](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/Publications/index.php?pub=491), and you can
find more details about the research work [in this paper summary](https://mcopik.github.io/projects/upm/).

## Original Kernel Documentation

Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
